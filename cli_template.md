# Install

All three major OS are supported (linux, OSX, windows).

## Using Nodejs

Requirements: [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/badge/nodejs-%3E=18.0.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://nodejs.org/en/).

```bash
npm -g install iexec # install the cli
iexec --version
iexec --help
```

## Using Docker

Requirements: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/).

```bash
# For Linux users
echo 'alias iexec='"'"'docker run -e DEBUG=$DEBUG --interactive --tty --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/iexec-project -v /home/$(whoami)/.ethereum/keystore:/home/node/.ethereum/keystore -w /iexec-project iexechub/iexec-sdk:latest'"'"'' >> ~/.bash_aliases && source ~/.bashrc
# For Mac OSX users
echo 'alias iexec='"'"'docker run -e DEBUG=$DEBUG --interactive --tty --rm -v /tmp:/tmp -v $(pwd):/iexec-project -v /Users/$(whoami)/Library/Ethereum/keystore:/home/node/.ethereum/keystore -w /iexec-project iexechub/iexec-sdk:latest'"'"'' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now run `iexec --version` to check all is working.

## Upgrade

- **Nodejs**: run `npm -g install iexec`
- **Docker**: run `docker pull iexechub/iexec-sdk`

## Init project

required steps before following any other workflow.

```bash
iexec init # create all required files
iexec wallet show # show your wallet
iexec storage init # initialize your remote storage
```

> _NB:_ iExec SDK CLI access the public blockchain (mainnet) through [ethers](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/) to connect different backends ([Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/), [INFURA](https://infura.io/)).
>
> Default API keys for backend services are provided for convenience.
> As these keys are shared across all users and are subject to rate limits, **you must use your own API keys** or better **your own node**.
>
> Get API keys for backend services:
>
> - [INFURA](https://infura.io/register) ([more details on Infura's blog](https://blog.infura.io/getting-started-with-infura-28e41844cc89/))
> - [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis)
> - [Alchemy](https://alchemyapi.io/signup)
>
> Once you created your access, you can add your API keys in the `chains.json` configuration file:
>
> ```json
> {
>    "default": ...,
>    "chains": { ... },
>    "providers": {
>      "infura": {
>        "projectId": "INFURA_PROJECT_ID",
>        "projectSecret": "INFURA_PROJECT_SECRET"
>       },
>     "etherscan": "ETHERSCAN_API_KEY",
>     "alchemy": "ALCHEMY_API_KEY"
>    }
> }
> ```
>
> If you run your own node, you can add an `host` key in the `chains.json` configuration file to target your node:
>
> ```json
> {
>    "default": ...,
>    "chains": {
>       ...
>       "mainnet": {
>         "id": "1",
>         "host": "http://localhost:8545"
>       }
>    }
> }
> ```
>
> Check your current host:
> `iexec info`

## wallet

To write on the blockchain, prove their identity and manage their assets, iExec's users need a wallet.

Wallet files are generated by [iexec init](#iexec-init) and [iexec wallet](#iexec-wallet) commands and stored in the Ethereum keystore.

The keystore location depends on your OS:

- Linux : ~/.ethereum/keystore
- Mac: ~/Library/Ethereum/keystore
- Windows: ~/AppData/Roaming/Ethereum/keystore

## iexec.json

The `iexec.json` file, located in every iExec project, describes the parameters used when creating a [app|dataset|category|workerpool], or when signing an order.

- `default` set the default chain used by the SDK cli.
- `chains` set the available chains
  - optional key `host` set the url of the ethereum node used by the SDK cli on each chain (overwrite default value).
  - optional key `hub` set the address of the hub used by the SDK cli on each chain (overwrite default value).
  - optional key `sms` set the url of the Secret Management Service used by the SDK cli on each chain (overwrite default value), this key accepts a string or a mapping TEE framework - SMS url.

  - optional key `enterprise` set the enterprise swap contract used by the SDK cli when working with enterprise enabled networks. `bridge.enterpriseSwapChainName` set the reference to the enterprise bound network.
  - optional key `native` specify whether or not the chain native token is RLC (overwrite default value: chain value or `false`).
  - optional key `useGas` specify whether or not the chain requires to spend gas to send a transaction (overwrite default value: chain value or `true`).
- optional key `providers` set the backends for public chains
  - optional key `alchemy` set Alchemy API Token

## deployed.json

The `deployed.json` file, located in iExec project, locally stores your latest deployed resources address. These address are used when you run a command without specifying a resource address (example: `iexec app show` will show the app in `deployed.json`).

```json
{
  "app": {
    "42": "0xa760FEfAd0a38D494890501120cB79f5EEAFeE28"

  }
}
```

## orders.json

The `orders.json` file, located in iExec project, locally stores your latest signed orders. This file is used when you publish an order on the Marketplace and when you fill orders without specified orders from the Marketplace.

```json

## ./secrets/

This folder is created when running `iexec result generate-encryption-keypair` or `iexec dataset init --tee` and is intended to store credentials generated by the iexec SDK CLI.

### ./secrets/beneficiary/

This folder stores the key pair to use for result encryption and decryption.
A key pair is generated when running `iexec result generate-encryption-keypair`
Public keys name follow the pattern _userAddress_\_key.pub , this key is shared with the workers when running `iexec result push-encryption-key`
Private keys name follow the pattern _userAddress_\_key this should never be shared with third party, the private key is used by the SDK CLI to decrypt a result when running `iexec result decrypt`.

### ./secrets/datasets/

This folder stores the AES keys used for dataset encryption.
A key is generated for each dataset file when running `iexec dataset encrypt`.
The key file is named after the dataset file name, last key generated is also stored in `./secrets/datasets/dataset.key` to be used as default secret to share with workers when running `iexec dataset push-secret`.

## ./datasets/

This folder is created when running `iexec dataset init --tee` and is intended to store datasets files.

### ./datasets/original/

Paste your original dataset files in this folder and run `iexec dataset encrypt` to encrypt them.

### ./datasets/encrypted/

This folder stores the encrypted datasets files.
An encrypted dataset file is created for each dataset file when running `iexec dataset encrypt`.
The encrypted dataset file is named after the dataset file name.
The encrypted dataset files must be upload on a public file system and referenced in multiaddr when running `iexec dataset deploy`.

# Interoperability

If your program is not written in javascript, your last option to use the SDK would be to spawn it as a separate process (sometimes called FORK operation). After each SDK run you should check the exit code returned by the SDK to know if the operation was successful or not `echo $?`:

- 0 = successful
- 1 = error

Finally, you could choose to parse the SDK stdout/stderr to access more information. Use the global option --raw to get json formatted output.

ex:

- `iexec wallet show --raw &> out.json`
- `iexec wallet show --raw | jq .`

Warning:

- The stdout/stderr is subject to changes (this is what makes this solution brittle)
- The node and docker version have some slight differences in their stdout/stderr
