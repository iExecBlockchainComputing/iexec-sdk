# Sept 16th, 2014
#   Variable names must be in uppercase (it works in lowercase, but may introduce
#   some missbehaviour under certain circumstances)
# The script "xtremwebconf.sh" uses perl to force upper cases;
# but it may happen that perl is not installed...

# Next defines the role as client
# This is used by the launcher

#### Location of temporary directories
# XtremWeb needs to use some disk space, for storing results of
# a computation. By defaults it will use /tmp/XW.user.dispatcher. 
# If you need to use an other directories uncomment this line and specify another
# directory.
# Note : please use full path; don't use ~ or any variable (e.g. $HOME)
#        they are not correctly interpreted
# TMPDIR=/tmp

####
# This defines a loop delay to get job status
# Property name : "client.loop"
# Property type : integer
# Default value : 60000
# This is in milliseconds
# This can not be less than 60000
## CLIENTLOOPDELAY=60000


####
# This is the time to wait for a each job to complete
#
# -----------------------
# This is in milliseconds
# Default is 15000
#
#TIMEOUT=15000

####
# This is the socket timeout; this is only used by UDP communication layer
# This is in milliseconds
# Default is 60000
# Setting it to zero means wait for ever; it is at your own risk, keep in mind that Zero may block the client for ever
#
#SOTIMEOUT=0

#
# This defines how many times we keep trying on socket timeout
# Default is 50
# This is forced to default value, if < 1
#
#SORETRIES=1

####
# commLayer is a String determining the communication layer to use
# Possible values : 
#   - xtremweb.communications.TCPClient   (this is the default)
#   - xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
#   - xtremweb.communications.UDPFTClient  (UDP is a very special case and should only be used with care)
#   - xtremweb.communications.XMLRPCClient (this does not work yet)
#
# Octobre 2005 :
#     UDP **ONLY** support minimalistic transfers (size < 16KB)
#     This is still a prototype :)
#     (conterpoint : if you are sure transfers are < 16KB, everything works just fine)
#     (transfers include app binary, job params etc.)
#
# Default is xtremweb.communications.TCPClient
#
#COMMLAYER=xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient

####
# commHandlers is a String determining the communication handlers
# This contains a comma separated list of colon separated tuples
#
# Example : 
#       xw:xtremweb.communications.TCPClient,http:xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
#
# Default is xw:<commLayer value>,http:xtremweb.communications.HTTPClient
# See commLayer

#
# optimizeZip tells to optimze zipping process or not
# Zip optimization is quite brutal : we just don't zip if there is only 
# one tiny file to zip since zipping has a huge CPU cost
# Otherwise, if there is more than one file, or if this one but huge file
# we do zip
#
# Default is true
#
#OPTIMIZEZIP=true

#
# optimizeNetwork to try to optimize network traffic
#
# Default is true

#### Keystore
# SSL requires a file to store the certificate provided by the XtremWeb Server

# Note : please use full path; don't use ~ or any variable (e.g. $HOME)
#        they are not correctly interpreted
SSLKEYSTORE=../keystore/xwhepclient.keys

# Client        : user X509 proxy file path
#                 The server validates it through its certificate paths.
# If this is an X509 proxy, its most trusted public key is used to authenticate
# the user (using server known certificate paths).
# An X509 proxy may be also used to forward jobs to EGEE 
# (or any so called Service Grig -ARC, UNICORE etc.).

# Default : $X509_USER_PROXY
